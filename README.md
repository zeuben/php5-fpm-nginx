# Introduction

This is Dockerfile to build a container for php5, nginx and php-fpm alone with
some commonly used php5 exentsions. Many thanks to [ngineered](https://github.com/ngineered/nginx-php-fpm)
for their work on [nginx-php-fpm](https://github.com/ngineered/nginx-php-fpm)


# Usage

* Pull the image from the docker hub:

```
docker pull yoanisgil/php5-fpm-nginx:latest
``` 

* Launch your application within the container provided by the pulled image:

```
docker run -p 8000:80 --name appname -v /app/root:/srv/www -v /path/to/nginx/log:/var/log/nginx yoanisgil/php5-fpm-nginx 
```

This will expose port 8000 on the host already mapped to port 80 on the container. "/app/root" is your application root,
which is usally where your index.php lives. We did not assume any particular application structure, so as long as the URL
path is a valid one to your application pages should be properly served, as well as static resources (See the note on static
files)


# Nginx configuration

Upon launch the startup script will setup as many nginx workers as available in the host. For further details refer to
file nginx.conf within this repository. 

It is worth saying that the default nginx/php/fpm configuration is not production ready and I *strongly* encorauge you 
to optimize it.

# Note on static files.

Nginx has been configured such that static files won't bre processed by php-fpm, nor log records will be created:

```
location ~* \.(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|css|js|ico|xml)$ {
    access_log        off;
    log_not_found     off;
    expires           5d;
}
```

# Silex example 

- Start by installing on a directory of your choice:

```
- mkdir silex-app
- composer require silex/silex:~1.2
```

- With the editor of your choice, add the infamous hello world route to your index.php file

```
<?php
require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php'; 

$app = new Silex\Application(); 

$app->get('/hello/{name}', function($name) use($app) { 
        return 'Hello '.$app->escape($name); 
}); 

$app->run();
```

- Launch the container :

```
docker run -p 8000:80 --name silex -v $(pwd):/srv/www -v /tmp:/var/log/nginx yoanisgil/php5-fpm-nginx
```

- You can now visit http://localhost:8000/hello/world

# Wordpress example

- Get a recent wordpress version (this image was tested with wordpress 4.2.2) from https://wordpress.org/download/

- Extract file contents anywhere in your filesystem and cd (change dir) to the resulting directory. 

- Launch the container:

```
docker run -p 8000:80 --name silex -v $(pwd):/srv/www -v /tmp:/var/log/nginx yoanisgil/php5-fpm-nginx
```

Your wordpress instance is now accesible on http://localhost:8000

# A note on OSX

If you are running docker on OSX then you need to run *boot2docker ip* to figure out which URL to enter in your browser.
Also since dockers on OSX actually run within a VirtualBox VM you need to be aware of how volumes work 
[see more here](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/)
